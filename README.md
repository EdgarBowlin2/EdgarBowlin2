- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Edgar Bowlin II, an Electronics and Software Engineer/Architect, degrees and many years experience in both. If you are looking for the Computer Science professor, that is my son, Edgar Bowlin III.

- ðŸ‘€ I have more than 30 years experience designing, implementing Oracle, SQL-Server, DB2 databases and database applications, both transactional (OLTP) and data warehouse (OLAP) databases. I'm also an electronics engineer and enjoy programming PLCs, IoT applications, raspberry pi apps, for example. Automation is key, whether hardware or software domain.

- ðŸŒ± I have 5 years AWS experience, EC2, RDS, Lambda, DMS, Aurora, etc. migrating on-prem Oracle / Linux infrastructure to the Cloud, but I have many more AWS components and coding tools thsy I am learning and applying as opportunities arise. I am beginning a career with Bamboo Health 06/16/2025 as a Senior Cloud Database Engineer and pursuing AWS certifications as appropriate.  Other tools that I have used, but am pursuing a deeper competancy with include Kafka, Ansible, Kubernetes, Docker, Splunk. Ideally, I want to have just the right level of knowledge and ability with tools in our current technology stack such that I can fully leverage them to develop, implement, and support optimal software solutions at scale with minimal cost. 

- The two areas I have the most experience in are electronics manufacturing and medical data management, although I have developed applications for a variety of small and medium sized businesses as well. 

- ðŸ“« Email me at ebowlin@bamboohealth.com or my personal email edgarbowlin2@gmail.com. I'm on Facebook and LinkedIn as well.  Happy Computing! Solve Problems, Write Code!

- Edgar
